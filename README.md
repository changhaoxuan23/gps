gps - GPU program set, (hopefully) handy utilities for people who use CUDA for accelerated computation.  
Use `make` to build, or `make debug` for a debugging build. A proper setup of environment variable CUDA_HOME will be required if `nvcc` cannot be found in your default PATH, or if to a different version of CUDA toolkit you want to link these utilities against.
